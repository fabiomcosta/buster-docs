<h1>Buster.JS Beta 2</h1>
<p>
  This is a brief (i.e. not exhaustive) overview of changes from Beta 1. Beta 2
  introduces quite a few fundamental refactorings and rewrites, and is
  significantly closer to a stable 1.0 release than its predecessor.
</p>
<p>
  With Beta 2, we've entered a more rapid iterative development and release
  cycle. In the four days since the initial release, three patch updates have
  already been shipped. "Beta 2" refers to Buster.JS version 0.4.1 or newer,
  until we decide to do a release candidate (or another major beta, if
  necessary).

<h2>Problems?</h2>
<p>
  Please <a href="https://github.com/busterjs/buster/issues">report as many
  issues</a> as you can, and
  consider <a href="https://github.com/busterjs/buster-docs">contributing
  docs</a> or file feature requests so we can improve documentation. Docs are
  behind on some things, but we're working on it.
</p>

<h2>Breaking changes</h2>

<p>This is a list of breaking changes in this release. Since we haven't reached 1.0 stable yet, we're changing APIs without making them backwards compatible.</p>

<h3>Config files can no longer read files outside of <code>rootPath</code></h3>

<p>Configuration file loading is revamped (most importantly, <a href="/docs/resources/">buster-resources</a> was completely rewritten).</p>

<p><code>sources</code>, <code>tests</code> etc can no longer contain paths outside the root path. The root path defaults to the path the configuration file is in. You can also provide the <code>rootPath</code> property in the configuration file to base the project outside the directory where the configuration file is located.</p>

<pre><code>config["My tests"] = {
    sources: ["../src/**/*.js"], // Will not work!
    tests: ["**/*-test.js"]
};

config["My tests"] = {
    rootPath: "../", // Will work (or just move the config file up one folder)
    sources: ["src/**/*.js"],
    tests: ["tests/**/*-test.js"]
};</code></pre>

<h2>Changes</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Stronger Node.JS inferences across the board.</li>
  <li>
    <a href="/docs/capture-server/">Capture server</a>: significant
    refactor. "Clients" are now "slaves" and several URLs have changed.
  </li>
  <li>
    Configuration file can now load <a href="/docs/extensions/">extensions</a>.
    A few are already availble, and others, like <a href="https://github.com/busterjs/buster/issues/15">buster-amd</a>
    and coverage is right around the corner.
  </li>
  <li>
    buster-promise is now deprecated and will not receive further updates. We
    recommend the wonderful <a href="https://github.com/cujojs/when">when.js</a>
    instead&mdash;it's what we use.
  </li>
  <li>
    Buster now syntax checks files before attempting to run tests in browsers. This
    ensures a stable environment with good feedback, regardless of target browser.
  </li>
  <li>
    The test runner was rewritten. It now supports per-test timeouts, the done
    callback can be used to wrap functions ("we're done when this function is
    called"), asynchronous <code>testCase</code> and <code>describe</code>,
    TeamCity reporter.
  </li>
  <li>
    The test runner now has a system for including other measures in a test run,
    issuing warnings, or even preventing tests from running at all. The first
    external tool included in this system
    is <a href="/docs/extensions/#lint">buster-lint</a>. Expect more thorough
    documentation of this system as it evolves.
  </li>
</ul>
