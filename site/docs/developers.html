<p>This page contains useful information for Buster.JS developers/contributors.</p>

<h2>Setting up development environment</h2>

<h3>First time setup</h3>

<p>If you don't already have <a href="http://nodejs.org/">node.js</a> installed, install it on your system.</p>

<p>The development environment is managed with a CLI, buster-dev-tools. Install it using the node.js package manager.</p>

<pre>npm install -g buster-dev-tools</pre>

<p>The tool will install all the buster packages to the folder you choose.</p>

<pre>mkdir buster
cd buster
buster-dev-tools install</pre>

<p>You also need to set some environment variables. <tt>{path to buster}</tt> is the path to the folder where you ran <tt>buster-dev-tools install</tt>.</p>

<pre>NODE_PATH={path to buster}
PATH={path to buster}/buster/bin:$PATH</pre>

<h3>Refreshing all repositories</h3>

<p>After some time you might want to update all the repos. To do so, use the <tt>update</tt> command.</p>

<pre>cd buster
buster-dev-tools update</pre>

<p>You need to cd to the directory where the packages are installed in order to use buster-dev-tools.</p>

<h2>Contribution guidelines</h2>

<p class="warning">Note: this section is work-in-progress</p>

<h3>Post questions to the busterjs-dev mailing list</h3>

<p>The <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/busterjs-dev">busterjs-dev mailing list</a> is a place for general discussion regarding development of Buster.JS. In many cases you can just post an issue to <a href="https://github.com/busterjs/buster/issues">the issue tracker</a> and the discussion can happen there. But you can also discuss on the mailing list if you're more comfortable with that. For example, you might prefer to use e-mail for discussion, or you want to discuss your contribution before posting it to the issue tracker.</p>

<h3>Always create an issue for your contribution</h3>

<p>We probably won't notice your contribution if all you do is submit a pull request on Github. But we monitor <a href="https://github.com/busterjs/buster/issues">the issue tracker</a>, so you should always post an issue when you create a pull request on GitHub, a merge request on Gitorious, or e-mail us a patch. Just link to your pull request(s) and explain your contribution.</p>

<p>Not creating pull requests are also fine. Create an issue and link to the feature branches and/or commits you want to contribute, be it on GitHub, Gitorious, or a link to a tarball of patches.</p>

<h3>Coding style</h3>

<p>We don't have one yet :)</p>

<p>For now, look at some existing code to get an idea of what our code looks like.</p>
