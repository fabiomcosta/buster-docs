<h1>Developers</h1>

<p>This page contains useful information for Buster.JS developers/contributors.</p>

<h2>Setting up development environment</h2>

<h3>First time setup</h3>

<p>If you don't already have <a href="http://nodejs.org/">node.js</a> installed, install it on your system.</p>

<p>The development environment is managed with a CLI, buster-dev-tools. Install it using the node.js package manager.</p>

<pre><code>npm install -g buster-dev-tools</code></pre>

<p>The tool will install all the buster packages to the folder you choose.</p>

<pre><code>mkdir buster
cd buster
buster-dev-tools install</code></pre>

<p>You also need to set some environment variables. <tt>{path to buster}</tt> is the path to the folder where you ran <tt>buster-dev-tools install</tt>.</p>

<pre><code>NODE_PATH={path to buster}
PATH={path to buster}/buster/bin:$PATH</code></pre>

<h3>Refreshing all repositories</h3>

<p>After some time you might want to update all the repos. To do so, use the <tt>update</tt> command.</p>

<pre><code>cd buster
buster-dev-tools update</code></pre>

<p>You need to cd to the directory where the packages are installed in order to use buster-dev-tools.</p>

<h2 id="docs">Running the documentation server</h2>

<p>
  To contribute docs, you will need to run the very simple docs server. To edit
  docs, you only need to know HTML. Here's how to get started:
</p>
<pre><code>git clone https://github.com/busterjs/buster-docs.git
cd buster-docs
npm install
node bin/server</code></pre>
<p>
  Now you can visit the docs on <a href="http://localhost:8090/">http://localhost:8090/</a>.
  The docs server simply combines docs pages with the <a href="https://github.com/busterjs/buster-docs/blob/master/layout.html">layout file</a>.
</p>
<p>
  URL mapping is very simple. Anything in <code>site/*.html</code> is available
  over the server as http://localhost:8090/*/. For instance, this page, whose
  (relative) URL is <a href="/docs/developers/">/docs/developers/</a> is
  generated from the file <a href="https://github.com/busterjs/buster-docs/blob/master/site/docs/developers.html">site/docs/developers.html</a>.
</p>
<p>
  You can make a static version of the site by running
  <code>node bin/build</code> (requires a running docs server).
</p>

<h2>Contribution guidelines</h2>

<p class="warning">Note: this section is work-in-progress</p>

<h3>Post questions to the busterjs-dev mailing list</h3>

<p>The <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/busterjs-dev">busterjs-dev mailing list</a> is a place for general discussion regarding development of Buster.JS. In many cases you can just post an issue to <a href="https://github.com/busterjs/buster/issues">the issue tracker</a> and the discussion can happen there. But you can also discuss on the mailing list if you're more comfortable with that. For example, you might prefer to use e-mail for discussion, or you want to discuss your contribution before posting it to the issue tracker.</p>

<h3>Always create an issue for your contribution</h3>

<p>We probably won't notice your contribution if all you do is submit a pull request on Github. But we monitor <a href="https://github.com/busterjs/buster/issues">the issue tracker</a>, so you should always post an issue when you create a pull request on GitHub, a merge request on Gitorious, or e-mail us a patch. Just link to your pull request(s) and explain your contribution.</p>

<p>Not creating pull requests are also fine. Create an issue and link to the feature branches and/or commits you want to contribute, be it on GitHub, Gitorious, or a link to a tarball of patches.</p>

<h3>Coding style</h3>

<p>We don't have one yet :)</p>

<p>For now, look at some existing code to get an idea of what our code looks like.</p>
